These apps work everywhere and provide several features that give them the same user experience advantages as native apps. This set of docs tells you all you need to know about them.\n\nPWAs should be discoverable, installable, linkable, network independent, progressive, re-engageable, responsive, and safe. To find out more about what these mean, read Progressive web app advantages.\n\nGoogle uses a helpful acronym for us to understand why PWAs are so effective: FIRE â€“ Fast, Integrated, Reliable, and Engaging.
